README Reflection:
How do I approach designing software?
  Structured Planning: I approach software design with structured planning, breaking down the project into manageable components. This helps in identifying key functionalities and defining a clear architecture for the software.
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  OpenGL Integration: The project has enhanced my skills in designing software that integrates with OpenGL. Understanding how to organize rendering pipelines and manage shaders for 3D scenes is a valuable skill developed.
What design process did you follow for your project work?
  Iterative Design: I followed an iterative design process, starting with basic shapes and gradually adding features. Regular testing and refinement were crucial to ensuring a stable and visually appealing 3D scene.
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  Modularity and Reusability: The emphasis on modularity in designing classes, such as the Shader and Camera classes, can be applied to future projects. This promotes code reusability and easier maintenance.
How do I approach developing programs?
  Incremental Development: I approach program development incrementally, implementing one feature at a time and testing thoroughly before moving on. This ensures that each component functions as intended before integrating into the larger system.
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  Shader Abstraction: Developing a Shader class for encapsulating shader functionalities was a new strategy. This abstraction streamlined the integration of different shaders for various objects in the scene.
How did iteration factor into your development?
  Continuous Refinement: Iteration played a vital role in the project. Regularly revisiting and refining the code based on testing and feedback contributed to a more polished and optimized implementation.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  Increased Efficiency: Over milestones, the development process became more efficient. Learning from earlier challenges, I adopted better coding practices, enhancing readability, and reducing redundancy.
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  Problem-Solving Skills: Computer science provides problem-solving skills that are transferable across various domains. This project reinforced the importance of logical thinking and algorithmic approaches to overcome challenges.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  Enhanced Understanding of Graphics: Computational graphics deepened my understanding of rendering processes, which can be beneficial for advanced courses in computer graphics or computer-aided design.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  Industry Relevance: The project equipped me with skills relevant to industries requiring 3D visualization, such as game development, simulation, and virtual reality. Understanding OpenGL and graphics programming is valuable in these professional domains.
